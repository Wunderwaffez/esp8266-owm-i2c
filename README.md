## What is this ?

This is a basic example of how to get weather data from OpenWeatherMap.org and display it on LCD display. **This code is originally written by Nick Koumaris aka educ8s.tv.** He used parallel LCD display in his project and I just changed it to use with I2C LCD display. 

## How to use it ?

**educ8s.tv** explained the code and showed how to use it in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2LBqUB7g3g.
